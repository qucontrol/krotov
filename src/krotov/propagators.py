r"""Routines that can be passed as `propagator` to :func:`.optimize_pulses`

The numerical effort involved in the optimization is almost entirely within the
simulation of the system dynamics. In every iteration and for every objective,
the system must be "propagated" once forwards in time and once backwards in
time, see also :mod:`krotov.parallelization`.

The implementation of this time propagation must be inside the user-supplied
routine `propagator` that is passed to :func:`.optimize_pulses` and must
calculate the propagation over a single time step. In particular,
:func:`qutip.mesolve.mesolve` is not automatically used for simulating any
dynamics within the optimization.  The signature for any `propagator`
must be the same as the "reference" :func:`expm` propagator:

    >>> str(inspect.signature(krotov.propagators.expm))
    '(H, state, dt, c_ops=None, backwards=False, initialize=False)'

The arguments are as follows (cf. :class:`Propagator`):

* `H` is the system Hamiltonian or Liouvillian, in a nested-list format similar
  to that used by :func:`qutip.mesolve.mesolve`, e.g., for a Hamiltonian
  $\Op{H} = \Op{H}_0 + c \Op{H}_1$, where $c$ is the value of a control field
  at a particular point in time, `propagator` would receive a list ``[H0, [H1,
  c]]`` where ``H0`` and ``H1`` are :class:`qutip.Qobj` operators.
  The nested-list for `H` used here, with scalar values for the controls, is
  obtained internally from the format used by :func:`~qutip.mesolve.mesolve`,
  with time-dependent controls over the entire time grid, via
  :func:`krotov.conversions.plug_in_pulse_values`.
* `state` is the :class:`qutip.Qobj` state that should be propagated, either a
  Hilbert space state, or a density matrix.
* `dt` is the time step (a float). It is always positive, even for
  ``backwards=True``.
* `c_ops` is None, or a list of collapse (Lindblad) operators, where each list
  element is a :class:`qutip.Qobj` instance (or possibly a nested list, for
  time-dependent Lindblad operators. Note that is generally preferred for `H`
  to be a Liouvillian, for dissipative dynamics.
* `backwards` (:class:`bool`): If passed as `True`, the `propagator` should
  propagate backwards in time. In Hilbert space, this means using -`dt` instead
  of `dt`. In Liouville space, there is no difference between forward and
  backward propagation. In the context of Krotov's method, the backward
  propagation uses the conjugate Hamiltonian, respectively Liouvillian.
  However, the `propagator` routine does not need to be aware of this fact: it
  will receive the appropriate `H` and `c_ops`.
* `initialize` (:class:`bool`): A flag to indicate the beginning of a
  propagation over a time grid. If False in subsequent calls, the `propagator`
  may assume that the input `state` is the result of the previous call to
  `propagator`.

.. warning::
    The routines in this module are provided with no guarantee to be either
    general or efficient. The :func:`expm` propagator is exact to machine
    precision, but generally extremely slow.  For "production use", it is
    recommended to supply a problem-specific `propagator` that is highly
    optimized for speed. You might consider the use of Cython_. This is key to
    minimize the runtime of the optimization.

The `initialize` flag enables "stateful" propagators that cache data between
calls. This can significantly improve numerical efficiency.
:class:`DensityMatrixODEPropagator` is an example for such a propagator. In
general, any stateful `propagator` should be an instance of
:class:`Propagator`.
