r"""Support routines for running the optimization in parallel across the
objectives.

The time-propagation that is the main numerical effort in an optimization with
Krotov's method can naturally be performed in parallel for the different
objectives. There are three time-propagations that happen inside
:func:`.optimize_pulses`:

1. A forward propagation of the :attr:`~.Objective.initial_state` of each
   objective under the initial guess pulse.

2. A backward propagation of the states $\ket{\chi_k}$ constructed by the
   `chi_constructor` routine that is passed to :func:`.optimize_pulses`, where
   the number of states is the same as the number of objectives.

3. A forward propagation of the :attr:`~.Objective.initial_state` of each
   objective under the optimized pulse in each iteration. This can only
   be parallelized *per time step*, as the propagated states from each time
   step collectively determine the pulse update for the next time step, which
   is then used for the next propagation step. (In this sense Krotov's method
   is "sequential")


The :func:`.optimize_pulses` routine has a parameter `parallel_map` that can
receive a tuple of three "map" functions to enable parallelization,
corresponding to the three propagation listed above. If not given,
:func:`qutip.parallel.serial_map` is used for all three propagations, running
in serial. Any alternative "map" must have the same interface as
:func:`qutip.parallel.serial_map`.

It would be natural to assume that :func:`qutip.parallel.parallel_map`
respectively the slightly improved :func:`parallel_map` provided in this module
would be a good choice for parallel execution, using multiple CPUs on the same
machine.  However, this function is only a good choice for the propagation (1)
and (2): these run in parallel over the entire time grid without any
communication, and thus minimal overhead.  However, this is not true for the
propagation (3), which must synchronize after each time step. In that case, the
"naive" use of :func:`qutip.parallel.parallel_map` results in a communication
overhead that completely dominates the propagation, and actually makes the
optimization slower (potentially by more than an order of magnitude).

The function :func:`parallel_map_fw_prop_step` provided in this module is an
appropriate alternative implementation that uses long-running processes,
internal caching, and minimal inter-process communication to eliminate the
communication overhead as much as possible. However, the internal caching is
valid only under the assumption that the `propagate` function does not have
side effects.

In general,

.. code-block:: python

    parallel_map=(
        krotov.parallelization.parallel_map,
        krotov.parallelization.parallel_map,
        krotov.parallelization.parallel_map_fw_prop_step,
    )

is a decent choice for enabling parallelization for a typical multi-objective
optimization (but don't expect wonders: general pure-python parallelization is
an unsolved problem.)

You may implement your own "map" functions to exploit parallelization paradigms
other than Python's built-in :mod:`multiprocessing`, provided here. This
includes distributed propagation, e.g. through ipyparallel_ clusters. To write
your own `parallel_map` functions, review the source code of
:func:`.optimize_pulses` in detail.

In most cases, it will be difficult to obtain a linear speedup from
parallelization: even with carefully tuned manual interprocess communication,
the communication overhead can be substantial. For best results, it would be
necessary to use `parallel_map` functions implemented in Cython, where the GIL
can be released and the entire propagation (and storage of propagated states)
can be done in shared-memory with no overhead.

Also note that the overhead of multi-process parallelization is
platform-dependent. On Linux, subprocesses are "forked" which causes them to
inherit the current state of the parent process without any explicit (and
expensive) inter-process communication (IPC). On other platforms, most notably
Windows and the combination of macOS with Python 3.8, subprocesses are
"spawned" instead of "forked": The subprocesses start from a clean slate, and
all objects must be transfered from the parent process via IPC. This is very
slow, and you should not expect to be able to achieve any speedup from
parallelization on such platforms.

Another caveat on platforms using "spawn" is that certain objects by default
cannot be transferred via IPC, due to limitations of the :mod:`pickle`
protocol. This affects :ref:`lambda` and functions defined in
Jupyter notebooks, in particular. The third-party :mod:`loky` library provides
an alternative implementation for multi-processes parallelization that does not
have these restrictions, but causes even more overhead.

You may attempt to use the various options to :func:`set_parallelization` in
order to find a combination of settings that minimizes the runtime in your
particular environment.
